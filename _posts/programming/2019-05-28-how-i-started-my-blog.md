## Summary

When I was presented with the idea of starting a blog, I had difficulty deciding how I was going to go about it.
Obviously my blog is up and running now and I can recommend that anyone looking to start a blog and have a little bit of coding experience, try GitHub pages and Jekyll.

## Context

I had faced 2 main challenges with starting a blog.

The first challenge I faced was the financial cost associated with hosting a blog.
I wanted to make money, not spend it!

First, I had to decide whether starting a blog was worth my time.
My collection of video games arn't going to play themselves!
Of course I also had a resume, and business projects that I could be working on but... priorities right?

## Details

Like a mature adult, the first thing I did was google search "best blogging platforms".

The results that came back were usually the same suggestions:

- Wordpress.org
- Wordpress.com (So confusing)
- Wix
- Blogger
- Medium
- etc.

Honestly, the costs associated with the platforms were not that high, but I refused to settle for anything more than free.
I wouldn't say that I am cheap, I prefer the word frugal.
I noticed that many of the free blogging platforms such as Wix were restricted in some form or another unless you either bought more features, themes, or upgraded to a premium plan.
Other options involved hosting a blogging engine yourself.
Due to my background with programming, I was not afraid to host my own blogging engine.
At first I considered Wordpress.org, an open source engine.
I would have had to pay for plugins as well as hosting costs.
After consulting with a friend, he suggested that I use Github Pages which is a free hosting service for static websites and integrates well with Jekyll, a blogging engine.
The best answers are not always provided by Google.

Determining whether this blog was worth my time was a whole different ball game though.
I was intimidated by the thought of having to learn a whole new ecosytem.

What I neede to learn were:

- MD or markdown files
- The jekyll framework
- Liquid syntax

After some thought I gave it a try and found it suprisingly easy.
The syntax is a bit weird and different from what I am used to but, it was very straightforward.

## Conclusion

I have to say, I am glad I decided to go with GitHub Pages and the Jekyll engine.
I am happy with the cost (can't beat free!) and am impressed with how easy it was to learn and start up.
