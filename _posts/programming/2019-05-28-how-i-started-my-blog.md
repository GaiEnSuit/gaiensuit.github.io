## I am still unsure how I got to this point

This blog was created on a whim because my friend said, "hey you should start a blog". I didn't know anything about that! So I did what any mature adult would do, I asked uncle google.

What I found was blogs posts about blogs; What platforms to blog on, the pros and cons of blogging. Honestly there was a lot of information and it was tl;dr.

As a programmer who has IMPORTANT PROJECTS to work on such as making sure I get enough sleep, updating my 'favourite video games' excel sheet, starting up a company, and keeping my girlfriend happy (probably should have put that one first), a blog was probably the last thing on my mind.

My friend suggested GitHub Pages and the Jekyll engine for my blog. I thought to myself "great another thing I don't know anything about". So I followed the [Startup Guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) and minutes later it was setup and ready to go... damn, so good!

But then I had to learn to add content to the darned thing, and the [Jekyll Official Website](https://jekyllrb.com/) (as good as it is) can be a little bit boring to read through. No one likes reading walls of text. So I looked up a helpful [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB). A few videos later, I pass out on my bed (I was watching on my tablet).

Yup that's it.

How long will I keep this up?
