<p>
    I assume you came to read about the blog. 
    Maybe you came to read about me(?)
    The name of the link isn't clear, but I didn't want to have 2 about pages...

    I started this blog because I was told (looking at you bro) that I had a sense of humor.
    I don't know about that.
    I just like to giggle a lot and hope people go along with it.
    If I can provide some sort of insight into what it means to exist as well as entertain, I have done my job.
    Other than that this blog is just another way for me to document something.
    I seem to have an obsession with documentation.
    Who else makes an color coded excel sheet of their favourite video games?
